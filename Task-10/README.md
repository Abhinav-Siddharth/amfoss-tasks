#### This was the last task and also the last one I picked to do but things really didn't go as planned.
#### I did get myself familiar with openCV and pillow and have tried to code the map myself but failed and I would've pushed harder but it was just a little late so I decided to properly form the repository instead and yeah that is it!!

#### Overall I had a really great time doing all the tasks and yeah looking forward to see you at the club ;)
