# APPROACH

### As a discord user for over 6 years the moment I looked at this task I knew it would be fun!!!!!

### I've used discord bots a hell lot of times over the years and not just to play but moderation commands as well. 

### I've been a moderator across several discord servers over the years and the largest one being a server named 'Dank trades' which had just over 100k members at the time I was a moderator.

### So yeah I'm familiar with the settings, roles etcc.. and learning to use discord.py was fun cuz for the fist time i made my own bot!!

### Overall my quickest task among all!!

### Definitely happy with the progress!!!
