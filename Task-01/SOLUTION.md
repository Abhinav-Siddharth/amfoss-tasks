Step 1:
I installed github cli then clonned the repo into my device using git clone.

Step 2:
Created a directory named "codes" using the mkdir cmd in terminal

Step 3:
Using the terminal commands, I completed the challenges and pushed them to github using the command sequence : git add > git commit -m "message" > git push origin main


(Commands used to find code: 
cd - code directory
ls - list
cat - concatenation/viewing file
touch/nano - To make and edit .txt files
python3 <spell.py> - to run the specific python code in order to get the secret code)


My approach:-

**First challenge:**
6 is the first perfect number as it is the sum of its proper postive divisors.
So 'x' in this case is 6
for y we have to differentiate the equation and by substituting x there we get 5.
so x = 6 and y = 5

so the code is in '06' folder and I opened the 'Spell_05.txt' inside the folder to get my first code and then run it using the spellbook. 
(Impedimenta.py)

**Second challenge:**
Similar to the above. The element is Germanium which has atomix number of '32' the unit digit is '2' and tenth digit is '3'.
y = '3' and x = '2'.
So the spell is in '02' folder and 'Spell_03.txt'.

**Third challenge:**
The shape shifting creature is boggart and the spell to use against it is 'Riddikulus'

**Fourth challenge:**
Went through the commit logs and found it.
x = '7' and y = '4'

Got the final code and made finalcode.txt and deleted all part codes and yeah its done!!!

Took me quite a while as I'm totally new to the terminal but it has been fun figuring stuff out and yeah enjoyed it all the way till the end and the congratulations message couldn't have been more satisfying!!!!
