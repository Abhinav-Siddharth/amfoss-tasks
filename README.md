# Amfoss Tasks

## ABOUT ME

#### I'm Abhinav Siddharth, an S3 RAE applicant. There might not be many applying from my branch but yeah I've got my reasons. I've tried applying for S2 recruitment but by the time the message came in our class group it was over and I immediately sent amfoss a mail but yeah couldn't have done anything.

#### Now this is the only chance for me to get in so I've done stuff I've never done before, staying locked in consistently for over a whole month!!! That's a whole acheivement by itself and I'm proud of that really. I saw unreal dedication waking earlier and working with confidence and insane productivity. 

#### I've learnt a lot throughout the journey, many ups and downs, making and breaking and here I am with about 8 Tasks in out of the 10 given.

#### It's not a great number given the ample amount of time but for a beginner as me, I feel like I've done pretty good to get those many down.

#### Overall I'm quite positve at the moment and I'm ready to tackle anything which comes on way and looking forward to be the same -- I will be!!!


## **Why should we choose you?**

#### I might not be the smartest one in the room but I guarantee that I'll be the one grinding hard even if others quit (you can have my word right there) and I know for a fact that once I get into amFOSS it's only getting better...

## **How do you intend to contribute back to the club?**

#### I have a natural interest in helping people, could be juniors or peers, I'm always open to support them. Also I'd love to participate in hackathons, win and get the pride !! Also parallely contributing to OSS

## **What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?**

#### I'd like to do stuff that aligns with my major (Robotics and AI) and stacking it with a strong knowledge of OSS which is the Foundation of lot of AI/robotics softwares and ROS is one of the software I really want to explore. Before all yeah mainly I want to learn more about OSS, keep on building skills and contribute to the club!
